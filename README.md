# Barrens

---
As you have travelled through worlds and explored its depths, the world around you has been changing.
Life has become scarce; the terrain changed, decayed. Survival impossible in such barren world.

## Wasteland

---

Wastelands have been abandoned and decayed over many years.
Its toxic air, acid rain and salty water provides limited habitability.  
Devoid of any natural life, its terrain feels empty during the day, and dangerous at night.

## Tech Notes


- **Wastelands**
  - Wasteland biome is heavily inspired by the terrain in Regrowth modpack.
  - Future Plans
    - Broken down structures
      - Maybe decayed villages that use dead oak wood
    - Biome Variation
      - Different dead wood types
    - Dirty/Salty/Poisonous Water
      - Some way to limit its uses.
      - Dangerous to touch maybe?
      - 
    - Toxic Air
      - Exposure can start to negatively impact player
      - Prolonged exposure can cause more permanent undesired effects
      - Way to purify an area of toxic air
    - Acid Rain
      - Similar to toxic air but more immediate danger
      - Ways of protecting (Armor perhaps?)
      - Potentially decays blocks if exposed for too long
- Ideas for future biomes
  - **The Dunes**
    - Inspired by Crash Landing modpack
    - Very flat terrain with very little elevation changes
    - Rare but rich in resources, abandoned cities
    - Sand Sharks
    - Sandstorms
